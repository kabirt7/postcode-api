### 14th March 2024

* My first thought is that I'll be using hash maps to pair up the suburb names with the postcodes
* I'm iffy on Java testing so this will be a focus for me
* Going to initalise my repo and Java file. I don't think any unique packages (ones that I haven't used before) will be needed.
* Need to plan out the data table/entity
